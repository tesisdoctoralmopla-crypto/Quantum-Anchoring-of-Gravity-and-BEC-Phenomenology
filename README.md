README: Quantum Anchoring of Gravity and BEC Phenomenology
This document, Constitutive Quantum Field Theory VI: Quantum Anchoring of Gravity and BEC Phenomenology, serves as the final validation stage of the Constitutive Quantum Field Theory ($\text{TCFQ}$) program. It analytically derives the hierarchical emergence of the low-energy phenomenological theory from the fundamental quantum field theory and sets precise experimental bounds on the theory's parameters.
Core Objectives and Significance
The primary goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between the fundamental $\text{TCFQ}$ and its low-energy counterpart, the Constitutive Theory of Gravity ($\text{TCG}$).
    • TCFQ Field: The theory is built upon the Absolute Quantum Phase Field ($\Phi$), a complex scalar field whose phase component, the fasón ($\varphi$ or $\chi$), mediates gravity and induces objective wave function collapse.
    • Hierarchical Emergence: The work provides the critical step of demonstrating the classical, low-curvature limit: $\text{TCFQ} \to \text{TCG}$.
Quantum Anchoring of the Gravitational Coupling
The procedure of taking the classical limit successfully provides a quantum anchoring for the phenomenological $\text{TCG}$ coupling constant, $\beta$.
    • Fasón Equation of Motion (EOM): The fasón dynamics include non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar $R$ and the matter trace $T$.
      $$\left(\square - m_\varphi^2\right) \varphi = q \cdot \left[R - \frac{1}{\Lambda_c^2} T\right] + \mathcal{O}(\varphi^2) \quad \text{[cite: 16]}$$
    • Classical Limit: By setting the fasón mass $m_\varphi \to 0$ and considering the quasi-static regime ($\square \varphi \approx 0$), and comparing the result with the $\text{TCG}$ field equation $\square \phi = -\beta T$, the fundamental relationship is established:
      $$\boxed{\beta = \frac{q}{\Lambda_c^2}} \quad \text{[cite: 20]}$$
      This relates the phenomenological constant $\beta$ (with an established value of $\beta \approx 8.3 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{m}^2/\text{kg}$) to the fundamental dimensionless coupling $q$ and the critical density scale $\Lambda_c$.
BEC Phenomenology (Laboratory Test)
The paper calculates a concrete, laboratory-based prediction by modeling the fasón's propagation through a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein Condensate ($\text{BEC}$).
    • Fasón Self-Energy ($\Sigma$): The self-energy introduced by the $\text{BEC}$ is derived from the polarization tensor $\Pi(\omega, \mathbf{k})$:
      $$\boxed{\Sigma(\omega, \mathbf{k}) \approx -\frac{g_\chi^2 n_0 m_{\text{atom}}}{\omega}} \quad \text{[cite: 23]}$$
      where $g_\chi$ is the effective coupling and $n_0$ is the condensate density.
    • Effective Mass: The modified dispersion relation introduces an effective mass $m_{\chi,\text{eff}}$ induced by the dense medium:
      $$\boxed{m_{\chi,\text{eff}}^2 = g_\chi^2 n_0 m_{\text{atom}} = \frac{\lambda^2 m_{\text{atom}}^3 n_0}{v^4}} \quad \text{[cite: 24]}$$
      This effect leads to a measurable, high-sensitivity target for future experiments in the form of a predicted retardation $\Delta t \sim 10^{-30}\ \text{s}$ for a fasón pulse traversing the $\text{BEC}$.
Experimental Bounds and Parameter Space
Current empirical evidence from objective collapse and fifth-force tests rigorously constrains the $\text{TCFQ}$ parameter space, leading to a "fully specified physical theory with zero free parameters".
Constraint Source	Parameter	Bound/Value
Objective Collapse/Coherence Tests ($\text{C}_{60}$, CSL/GRW) 	Fasón Coupling ($q$)	$\boxed{q \lesssim 10^{-10}}$
Fifth Force/Torsion Tests ($\text{Eöt-Wash}$) 	Fasón Mass ($m_\varphi$)	$\boxed{m_\varphi < 10^{-20} \text{ eV}}$
TCFQ Seed Value (Inferred)	Critical Scale ($\Lambda_c$)	$\approx 10^{20}\ \text{GeV}$
Next Steps
The $\text{TCFQ}$ framework's falsifiability is defined by its predictions across three independent domains: molecular interferometry, $\text{BEC}$ dynamics, and tests of the Equivalence Principle. The next step in the research program is to address the non-linear regime of the fasón dynamics, focusing on the emergence of $\text{MOND}$ phenomenology in Paper VII.
